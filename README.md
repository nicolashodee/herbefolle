## MY FIRST CUSTOM WORDPRESS THEME, MADE FROM SCRATCH . 
<table>
<tr>
<td>
  
  L'herbe Folle is a restaurant based in Aix en Provence, France. 
  The existing website was based on Wordpress, with a basic theme downloaded from the Wordpress theme gallery (Rinzai). Not really fancy and seen a thousand times. 
  During May 2021, I've completely redesigned the website and added more impacting content and learned how to make my first custom Wordpress theme from scratch.
